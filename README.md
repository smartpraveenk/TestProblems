Algo and Design Problems solution

Solution for problems :

1. A string "aBIY" is said to be a well-ordered word as each of the letters are in sequential manner regardless of case. So, "AbLe" is not a well-ordered word. You are a anti-hacker. You have a number of character sequences. Write a program to generate all possible well-ordered word that can be generated by those numbers of given character sequences.
2. Design an ATM machine (implement money transactions only. e.g. the machine takes request to withdraw money, verifies user credentials and dispense money)
